# 📱 Mobile Development Setup with Expo Go

## 🎯 Objective

Mobile development requires more computational resources than web development. To streamline the process and reduce hardware dependency, we’ll be using the **Expo Framework for React Native**, which simplifies mobile app development and testing.

This guide walks you through setting up **Expo Go** on your physical device, enabling you to preview and test React Native applications without relying on emulators.

## ✅ Prerequisites

Ensure the following tools are installed and ready:

| Tool          | Purpose                             |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Node.js (LTS) | JavaScript runtime for development  |
| VS Code       | Recommended IDE for coding          |
| OS            | macOS, Linux, or Windows            |
| Expo Go       | Mobile app for testing React Native |

## 📦 Why Use Expo Go?

Traditional mobile development depends on emulators, which require high-performance machines and frequent updates to match evolving devices (e.g., iPhone 7 → iPhone 16 Pro Max, various Android models).

**Expo Go** offers a lightweight, cost-effective alternative:

- Test apps directly on your physical device.
- Supports both **iOS** and **Android**.
- Eliminates the need for emulators or native builds during early development.
